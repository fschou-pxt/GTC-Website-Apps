This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
color_palatte <- 
    tribble( 
        ~color1,   ~color2,   ~color3,   ~color4,   ~color5,   ~color6,   ~color7,   ~color8,   ~color9,
        "#F1C232", "#445760", "#546E7A", "#7895A2", "#AAAAAA", "#DDDDDD", "#F0F0F0", "#FFFFFF", "#CC0000"
    ) %>% t(.) %>% as.data.frame() %>% rownames_to_column(var = "color_order") %>% mutate(size = 1) %>% arrange(color_order)

ggplot(color_palatte, aes(x = V1, y = size)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = V1)) + scale_fill_manual(values = color_palatte$V1)


weight_plot

weight_plot_output <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)) + geom_point()
weight_plot_output

pdf("file.pdf", width = 7, height = 7)
            ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)) + geom_point()
            dev.off()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
